A Decentralized Web Hosting System

The way web hosting works today is by hosting all the web content including textual content, code and media content on a centralized location which can then be accessed over the world wide web. But did you know? Your site is going to be down when there is server maintenance or if a load of the server gets high.

What if with blockchain, your website doesnâ€™t require a central server? With blockchain, you can split your website content into granules and distribute it all over the internet and then link them together using a blockchain registry.
